* 🧠 I've been working with **AI-related technologies** since 2017 — from Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning to modern LLMs.
* 🏆 My proudest moment? Achieving **5th place** in the [OpenAI Retro Contest (2018)](https://openai.com/index/retro-contest-results/) as a solo developer under the team name **"Students of Plato"**.

> *“Students of Plato” – #5 out of 229 teams. Not bad for a one-man army.*

### 💼 What I'm Doing Now

* 🔍 Exploring the **possibilities of AI** and its real-world applications
* 🌍 Translating programming documentation to make valuable resources more accessible
* 💻 Working full-time as a Web Developer using **React**, **Astro**, **Tailwind**, **Storybook**, and **Next.js**
